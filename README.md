>>>>>>> 2.0.0-alpha
> [!WARNING]
> This is not a project developed with the intention of being easily understood or utilzied. It is not meant for distribution! It is on github for the sole puprose of me being able to quickly transfer it via manfiests to hosted Foundry instances.

It contains AI art and is meant for personal use at my tables and for the context of what I am building.

When it is transitioned to being production-ready, this README will have the warning(s) removed and more how-to content added.
